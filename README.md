> The Ranch is an application where users can logged in as farmers through Google Firebase Authentication and have the ability to add or remove cows from their ranch.

By the end of building this application, I was able to: 
- Authenticate users using Firebase Authentication
- Understand and create JSON
- Demonstrate understanding of API calls using Postman
- Create API requests in codebase using Axios
- Understand and create ERDs
- Demonstrate understanding of spread operators
- Demonstrate understanding of destructuring objects
- Apply CRUD functionality to a single page application which includes, but is not limited to:
  - Creating forms for creating a cow
  - Creating an edit form to edit cows
  - Creating an edit form to edit users
  - Delete cows and farmers (which include the farmer's cows)
  - Read/GET items from the API and render them to the DOM using Bootstrap cards
